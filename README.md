# Sean Williams

This is the README.md content. It serves as the content for your homepage. You're looking at the starterkit right now. If you've got any suggestions/improvements feel free to create an PR. You can check out a demo [here](https://vuepress-starter-demo.netlify.com/). Netlify runs `npm run build` on every commit and then publishes the `/dist` directory. Simple as that.
